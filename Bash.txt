# Open the Terminal on your Mac.

# Navigate to the folder where your zip files are located by typing the cd command:

cd /path/to/your/zip/files

# Create the destination folders if they don't exist
mkdir -p SS NI II

# Move files based on the presence of SS, NI, or II in the filename
for file in *.zip; do
    if [[ "$file" == *"-SS-"* ]]; then
        mv "$file" SS/
    elif [[ "$file" == *"-NI-"* ]]; then
        mv "$file" NI/
    elif [[ "$file" == *"-II-"* ]]; then
        mv "$file" II/
    fi
done

echo "Files have been moved to the appropriate folders."

# Explanation:
# The mkdir -p SS NI II command creates folders (SS, NI, and II) if they don't exist.
# The for file in *.zip command loops through all .zip files in the current directory.
# The if statements check if the filename contains -SS-, -NI-, or -II- and move the file to the corresponding folder using mv.
# Once you run these commands, check if your zip files have been moved to their respective folders (SS, NI, or II). Let me know if you encounter any other issues!
